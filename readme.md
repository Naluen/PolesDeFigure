# The important configure

There are only three parameter needs configure:

1. beam_intensity: The intensity of the source X-ray beam.
2. thickness: In Angstrom, thickness of the layer corresponding the peak.
3. phi_offset: Used to turn the PF image, until the A,B,C,D peak at the right position( like the sample_PF.png).

After the set, simply open the simple_UI.py and choose your sample file. All the result will be placed in the sample directory as the sample file.

After the first-run for each sample, the configure will be copied to the directory which contains the \*.raw file, which would be used later.
